# Online/Offline Budget Tracker

This is a straightforward budgeting Progressive Web App with online/offline capability. 

# Usage

The user is able to add or subtract funds to their account and the chart shows their cash flow. The user is also able to see all transactions that they have entered with their corresponding amounts.

As stated before, this is a PWA and also has offline capability. So if a user were to, say, go on an airplane, and they didn't want to pay for crazy expensive Wi-Fi, but also had been keeping track of their cash flow with this app, they would be able to continue using the app on their phone while in airplane mode.

# Installation

To use this web app as a PWA the user simply needs to open the website in Chrome on their phone, go to settings, and click add to home screen. This will prompt the user to give the app a name if they want something different than the suggested name, and will add the site to their home screen as an app with the provided icon from the manifest.
